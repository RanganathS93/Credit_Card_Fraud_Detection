# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Project Overview:

Working with a team of four and given a data set of multiply predictors and binary classification representing credit card fraud, create a machine learning model that can identify future fraudulent credit card transactions. Divide work among team members and use GitHub and Google Co-lab for version control.  

Summarized Process:

Cleanse the data by handling null values, outliers and perform EDA to spot anomalies. Standardize the data using Robust Scaler and Min-Max scaling techniques. Perform Undersampling and Oversampling techniques to get a balanced dataset. Apply various classification models and Sequential Neural Network on both the imbalanced and balanced dataset. Compared the classification report of all the models based on different metrics such as Precision, Recall and F1 scores and selected the best model suitable for classification.
